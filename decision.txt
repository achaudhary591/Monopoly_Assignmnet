# Design and Architectural Decisions

## Technology Stack
- Spring Boot: Simplifies backend development and provides embedded Tomcat.
- Spring Data JPA: For database interactions and easier data management.
- H2 Database: In-memory database for quick setup and teardown in a development environment.

## Design Patterns
1. **Singleton**: Ensured that the GameController and GameService are managed as singletons by Spring Framework, which is standard for Spring Beans.
2. **Repository Pattern**: Used for data access layers to separate business logic from data access logic.
3. **Service Pattern**: Encapsulates the business logic of the application, providing a clear separation from the controller's request handling.
4. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Used MVC pattern where GameController acts as the controller, GameService as the model (business logic), and JSON responses as the view.

## Architectural Decisions
- RESTful API Design: Chose REST principles for API design to ensure stateless communication and standard operation using HTTP verbs.
- Transaction Management: Applied @Transactional annotations to ensure data consistency and handle transactions smoothly at the service layer.
- Exception Handling: Global exception handling with @ControllerAdvice to manage exceptions and return proper HTTP responses.

## Scalability Considerations
- While the current requirement is for a single game at a time, the design allows for easy scaling to multiple games by adjusting the database schema and service logic to handle multiple game sessions.

## Security Decisions
- Added basic authentication to ensure that only authenticated users can create, manage, and delete games. (Assuming implementation of Spring Security for this setup.)

These decisions were made to ensure that the application is robust, maintainable, and scalable.
